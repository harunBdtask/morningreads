Government officials belonging to different ministries and departments were involved in making these plans. While the government must be congratulated for formulating a plan to regain the rivers to be implemented over several phases, our experience of implementation of masterplans is rather bad. The first and foremost question is that the authorities have not shared with any stakeholder precisely how they have gone about making the master plans, or without taking any inputs from them.</p>\r\n<p>We have, over the decades, witnessed the lack of commitment of the authorities to master plans. They have been openly flouted, regardless of court rulings and campaigns by activists and the media. Hence, the latest plans ought to be taken with a pinch of salt because all the rhetoric that has been made at policy level over the last two decades about protection and preservation of rivers have resulted in exactly the opposite, i.e. more encroachment, more pollution and nothing of substance about following what is written in master plans.</p>\r\n<p>This brings us back to the question of implementation of the plan in toto. What we do not need are futile and hollow promises. Unlike other master plans, such as the Dhaka DAP, we hope that it will not be scuttled by vested interest groups.

Reportedly, a new master plan has been made for the university, and the trees have been cut down according to that plan, of which the teachers, students and the university community are not aware.</p>\r\n<p>Since many of the teachers have alleged that the university authorities have kept them in the dark over the matter, we would suggest that the authorities make the master plan public.

Therefore, the university authorities should move away from any decision that will harm the university&rsquo;s environment and make the green campus look like a concrete jungle.

(25, 'Privacy violations, the rise of Big Data and Orwell’s premonition', '<p>In&nbsp;George Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel 1984, the fictional omniscient entity &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; seemed like an absurd&nbsp;possibility even a decade back. For an all-knowing being to exist in a society that had access to a constant flow of information was not common in everyday narratives of the time. Fast track to 2019 and what we have is an emergence of Big Data that is slowly helping us spiral towards an eerily similar reality. There is no shock factor to this phenomenon. The biggest source of this gigantic accumulation of data is the people themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Facebook, despite its privacy-breaching scandals is exponentially growing, with 2.32 billion monthly&nbsp;users as of December 31 last year. While it managed to land itself in user security controversy and outrage, its revenues have only increased. Never has any enterprise before managed to constantly accumulate data of over two billion people. It did so by fostering a culture of sharing among the digital nomads&mdash;when we experience something new, we tend to capture or record it, when we record it, we upload it and finally we share it with our own selection of audience. But is it shared only within our selected circle? The latest events that have occurred suggest otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>Last month, in a courtroom debate in San Francisco, lawyers defending Facebook in a litigation issuing from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, declared, rather too matter-of-factly, what we have been feeling apprehensive about&mdash;users should have no rational expectation of privacy from social media. Further arguments ensued to and fro where it was, revealed that the tech giant treats privacy as something binary, rather than nuanced. The moment users choose to share their posts with others, their privacy gets compromised. If that is the case, the option of being able to tweak one&rsquo;s desired selection of audience should be announced as redundant. This new turn of events definitely added more fuel to the controversy that originated since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Just a year back, Mark Zuckerberg sat in front of members of both houses of Congress, uttering the word privacy numerous times and each time, emphasising on how the company policy advocates for the privacy of its users. This year, he had penned down a 3,000-word monologue&mdash;the foundations of which is based on personal privacy&mdash;where he promised to reconstruct the image of his company. But with that still fresh in memory, his lawyers are delivering contradicting statements. Both these scenarios emerge from the same company at stake but both cannot be the truth.</p>\r\n<p>According to a Ted Talk by Yuval Noah Harari, best-selling author of Sapiens and Homo Deus, liberalism is currently under threat given the direction of information collection and dissemination is being steered towards by these &ldquo;Silicon Valley Prophets&rdquo;. Liberalism, in theory, is based on the capacity of people&rsquo;s free will. The intricacies of our society play out in a way that prioritises the freedom of willpower and decision-making over everything else&mdash;customers are always right and voters can and will choose whoever they deem is worthy, but, now with the unification of biotech and infotech coupled with immeasurable data being amassed from billions of global users, a new structure is being constructed that would not only be able to identify our emotions but will also manipulate them. Information will be tailored on an individual basis that will influence their decisions and eventually question the freedom of choice. The classic example can be drawn from when Facebook exposed the data of its 87 million users to Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy firm that was involved with Trump&rsquo;s presidential campaign. Since then, legal and ethical questions have arisen while the firm was held culpable for influencing the democratic agenda.</p>\r\n<p>This event highlighted the loopholes in social media privacy policies, the terms of which we agree to without the slightest hesitation. Providing a mere review on a restaurant or liking a page on social media would trigger an algorithmic pattern exclusive to each individual. Users fail to realise that every click is leaving behind a digital footprint that contributes to an inconspicuous process of data curation that is not just utilised to suggest advertisements but is being exploited for profit maximisation of power-hungry corporations and/or to further the agenda of other political entities. It is almost as if people are being made to become comfortable with the idea of social experimentation despite transparency and accountability being largely absent.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Silicon Valley giants have furthered the use of these patterns to permeate all online activities of users. One might simply ask, &ldquo;Why is my personal data so important?&rdquo; But these tech companies do not really care about individualistic personal data or the mundane details of one&rsquo;s life. What they are interested in is the metadata from which physiological portfolios can be drawn and used to manipulate behaviour. The Federal Trade Commission has recently decided to impose a fine of five billion dollars on Facebook due to the earlier privacy violations&mdash;a penalty that falls flat against the repercussions it has instigated while the amount is being compared to a mere &ldquo;parking ticket&rdquo; for a corporation of this magnitude.</p>\r\n<p>Data collection and its merger with complimentary technology have provided human beings with countless noteworthy privileges and contributions. Although, the term Big Data, has a negative connotation to it, we cannot deny how our modern state of affairs have thrived in this digital ecosystem. Yet, there are no benefits without costs. Social media platforms are now like an unregulated marketplace that needs intervention from all stakeholders&mdash;be it the political commanders, the pioneers of the tech companies and, most importantly, the users themselves. The whole business model would collapse if enough number of users withdraw or unsubscribe from such domains. Likewise, the human race today is also heavily reliant on these platforms. It appears that both parties involved here are at stake, and will have to meet at a common ground. The recent endemic of privacy violations must not be treated as just a threat anymore but also as a wakeup call for this era.</p>', '2019-07-24 08:47:00', '0', '9', '2', '1563957948bw_ed_2_63.jpg', ' Naomi Okubo,Advice ,Airbnb Magazine,case studies,Life Lessons,Startup,Tech,Women In Tech');

(26, 'How black money can and cannot be reduced', '<p>Moving&nbsp;against the current of expert opinion, the government, in the budget for FY2019-20, opened up a five-year scheme to convert black money into white. The plan will allow people with undisclosed income to invest the money in special economic zones and high-tech parks by paying a flat rate of 10 percent tax without having to answer any questions, and permit them to purchase land, flats and apartments by paying tax of Tk 500 to Tk 15,000 per square metre.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a controversial decision, primarily in light of the fact that the lowest tax slab in Bangladesh is 10 percent and the highest is 25 percent. Meaning that black-money-holders will be able to whiten their money paying the lowest tax rate, and honest businessmen who pay higher rates of tax will lose out to them for not being corrupt.</p>\r\n<p>While the government is financially incentivising dishonesty in that way, it is arguing that the move is necessary to bring undisclosed income back into the formal economy, to increase its tax net and boost the country&rsquo;s stagnant private sector investment. But if we look at the data, we see that between 1972 and 2017, Tk 18,372 crore was whitened in Bangladesh with the NBR receiving Tk 1,528.74 crore in taxes only. And of the Tk 18,372 crore collected during this entire period, Tk 9,682 crore has been whitened during the tenure of the last caretaker government, while under both AL and BNP governments, the amount of money that has been whitened each year under such schemes is negligible&mdash;which leaves no reason to believe that it will be different now under the AL government.</p>\r\n<p>What this plan does, however, is give people who have amassed their wealth in illegitimate ways&mdash;through crimes and corruption&mdash;the chance to get rid of the financial trail of their wrongdoings and avoid questioning while they are at it, should they need to do so. This essentially leaves them with a &ldquo;get out of jail free&rdquo; card to use in times of trouble. Meanwhile, there is another problem&mdash;that of the actual black money and the underground economy, which the current government scheme cannot solve.</p>\r\n<p>According to a 2015 IMF report, the size of the black economy in Bangladesh stood at around Tk 4,532.71 billion. And a 2012 finance ministry report prepared on the underground economy estimated that black money amounted to around 45 percent to 85 percent of Bangladesh&rsquo;s GDP. Despite the difference in estimates, what both reports suggest is that huge sums of money are lurking in our underground economy which are not only being generated as a result of crime and corruption, but are also being used to commit more corruption and crime.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This produces an invisible cycle that is difficult to translate into monetary terms, but is devastating nonetheless in terms of the social costs that it imposes. Similarly, because of its nature, finding the real monetary value of the black economy is difficult too, and such estimates often end up undervaluing the true size of the underground economy. And so there is no question that the government does have a big problem on its hands.</p>\r\n<p>Although black money is most often associated with illegitimate activities, in Bangladesh, black money is considered as money earned both legally on which no tax has been paid, as well as money earned illegally and also untaxed. This means that black money can be reduced by strengthening the tax system.</p>\r\n<p>Years ago, the NBR chairman had disclosed that the number of persons paying more than Tk 100,000 as personal income tax in 2011-2012 had not even surpassed one thousand, despite there being 23,212 multi-millionaires in the country. We have seen the latter figure go up year after year. But the former has not increased in accordance with that. This shows one of the most significant weaknesses of our tax system&mdash;its failure to bring the rich&rsquo;s share of the wealth under the tax net which, to some extent, is actually a political problem.</p>\r\n<p>According to Dr Muinul Islam, professor, Department of Economics, University of Chittagong, &ldquo;Black money revolves around the concept of illegally obtained money through political and/or bureaucratic corruption, bribery at all levels of the government,&rdquo; among others. Naturally then, the problem of political and bureaucratic nepotism and favouritism is deeply entrenched in the entire issue of black money. Since it is usually very difficult to separate the two, in order to reduce the share and influence of black money in society, countries must have strong institutions to fight corruption. And that is what we lack most severely. It is this lacking that has given rise to black money growing in Bangladesh in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>This is why the government, instead of trying to cure the symptom of this illness, by launching initiatives to allow the whitening of black money, should look to address the cause, which are the activities that generate black money. This includes strengthening regulatory and monitoring institutions, and granting greater independence to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), whose actions over the years have been anything but bold. However, a great part of why that is, is because of political interference from government high-ups, preventing the ACC and other regulators from pursuing cases against those who are somehow connected to the ruling party of the day or other influential quarters. That, too, must change if the problem of black money is to be addressed effectively.</p>', '2019-07-24 08:50:02', '0', '9', '2', '1563958119bw_ed_1_55.jpg', ' Naomi Okubo,Advice ,Airbnb Magazine,case studies,Life Lessons,Startup,Tech,Women In Tech'),
(27, 'History writing in South Asia and Prof Abdul Karim', '<p>In 1990, when I was striving to enter the world of doctoral research, my father, who was an eminent historian, placed three books on my table with the assurance that if I thoroughly read them, I would be on my way to select a research topic for myself. The book that first drew my attention was a classic by Professor Abdul Karim entitled&nbsp;Social History of the Muslims in Bengal. It was accompanied by two other scholarly works, i.e.&nbsp;Bengal Under Akbar and Jahangir: An Introductory Study of Social History, by Tapan Kumar Roy Chaudhuri, and&nbsp;Social and Cultural History of Bengal, by MA Rahim. Eventually, these three seminal works, which were dedicated to the study of medieval Bengal, helped me a lot to select my research topic related to Islam and Islamic mysticism in Bengal. I have no hesitation to admit that an intensive and extensive reading of Professor Karim&rsquo;s scholarly works solved my personal academic crisis in the sense that ultimately, I was able to identify the area of my research interest. I exposed myself to some of the works of Professor Karim during my undergraduate days at Jadavpur University. However, my rediscovery of Professor Karim as a legendary historian occurred during my research days.</p>\r\n<p>It would be easier to understand a scholar of Professor Karim&rsquo;s stature if we locate him on a larger canvas. Largely due to the influence of colonial historiography, the pioneering medievalists of the subcontinent revealed a North India-centric or Mughal-centric approach, if not bias, in their writings as if the geo-cultural regions beyond the epicentric Northern India constituted the periphery of our historical engagements relating to South Asia. If we analyse the evolution of history writing in South Asia remembering this perspective, we can hardly miss the representative role played by the academic trio mentioned above. Indeed, Professor Karim marked a shift in history writing from a North India-centric approach to regional history writing and, in our case, that region happened to be Bengal.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Professor Karim was not merely writing history, he was creating history as his scholarly contributions with its major shift have to be understood in the larger context of the identity formation process of the Bangla-speaking people. Eminent historian Nihar Ranjan Ray, in his monumental work on Bengal and the Bengalees, written in Bangla, confined his focus to ancient Bengal. Since he did not master Persian, he inflicted this constraint upon himself. But Arabic and Persian knowing Abdul Karim traversed the world of Medieval Bengal with ease as that linguistic expertise enabled him to tap the original sources related to that period. However, Nihar Ranjan and Abdul Karim shared one or two things in common in their research engagements.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, both endeavoured to emancipate historical research from an obsessive commitment to political, administrative or military history and demonstrated the significance of spilling over to social and cultural history of the Bangla-speaking people. Nihar Ranjan and Abdul Karim&rsquo;s research experiences in Holland and England, respectively, made them aware of this trend which engulfed Europe largely due to the pioneering efforts of the French historians.</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, both of them, along with other greats such as Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Enamul Huq, Jagadish Narayan Sarkar, and Amalendu De, had realised the importance of writing history in vernacular Bangla, in order to reach out to a larger circle of readers beyond the confines of classrooms or seminar rooms of leading academic institutions. Indeed, historical consciousness should not be monopolised by a few academic institutions. Thus, Abdul Karim and the above-mentioned historians did not merely get involved in the act of history writing in South Asia, but also became an integral part of a historical movement aimed at communicating with a larger audience. A sense of history is essential for the sustenance of vibrant democracies, dynamic economies and pluralistic societies.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The third major contribution of Professor Karim was to challenge the colonial periodisation of South Asian history. To provide an ideological base for the divide-and-rule policy, the British administrator cum Indologists divided Indian history into three distinct periods, i.e. Ancient or Hindu golden age, Medieval or Muslim dark age, and Modern or British period. Many scholars such as Sir Jadunath, Jagadish Narayan Sarkar, Habibullah, MR Tarafdar, NK Bhattasali, Tapan Roy Chaudhuri, Abdul Karim and some others implicitly challenged such colonial historiographical stance by carrying out research on topics related to medieval South Asia.</p>\r\n<p>Fourthly, there is a saying that historians are notorious for their confinement to the libraries and archives and anthropologists are notorious for their field works. Abdul Karim was one of the pioneers amongst South Asian historians who combined both. His intensive and extensive fieldworks culminated in the publication of his magnum opus, entitled&nbsp;Corpus of The Arabic and Persian Inscriptions of Bengal.</p>\r\n<p>Fifthly, he belonged to that rare brand of historians who could successfully reconcile academic and administrative responsibilities. This rare quality he demonstrated during his tenure as the Vice-Chancellor of Chittagong University where he had to negotiate with various high commissions, particularly German and British, to elevate the upcoming university in the international academic map. Professor Karim&rsquo;s liberal, spiritual and human outlook is manifested in the brilliant chapter on the sufis in his famous book with which we began this essay.

(28, 'Save Dewanbari before it’s too late', '<p>Dewanbari is a beautiful historic site located at Aminbazar, Dhaka. Declared as a &ldquo;heritage site&rdquo; through a gazette notification on February 2, 2009, the complex is comprised of a palatial residence, a three-domed mosque, a pond and a graveyard. Moreover, the compound is surrounded by an identical low-height boundary wall which is quite a unique feature among the heritage structures. Regrettably, the property&rsquo;s fractional ownership along with the negligence of the authorities concerned are the main reasons for its current dilapidated state.</p>\r\n<p>However, according to the Heritage Gazette and the Antiquities Act, 1968, no listed heritage property can be demolished, reconstructed, altered, and modified in the name of development without the approval of the government&rsquo;s Nagar Unnayan Committee (NUC). The NUC is headed by the secretary of the ministry of housing and public works and representatives from different professional groups including architects, city-planners, archaeologists, and historians as well as civil society members.</p>\r\n<p>One of Dewanbari&rsquo;s present owners expressed his disappointment at the futile attempts to save the compound. According to him, they had several meetings with the authorities concerned including Rajuk, Department of Archaeology, and Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and wrote quite a few letters, but unfortunately, they did not receive any assistance to prevent illegal encroachment and demolition of their valued possession.</p>\r\n<p>One of Dewanbari&rsquo;s present owners, Bashir Ahmed, has expressed his disappointment at the futile attempts to save the compound. According to him, they had several meetings with the authorities concerned including Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), Department of Archaeology, and Ministry of Cultural Affairs, wrote quite a few letters (including one addressing the prime minister in 2018), but unfortunately, they did not receive any assistance to prevent illegal encroachment and demolition of their valued possession. Furthermore, their appeal for the provision of basic amenities like gas and water has also been denied for many years, whereas their neighbouring villages had those amenities already.</p>\r\n<p>The building was built in 1880 by Alhaj Janab Ali, who was a revenue collector of the British East India Company. The original site had about 106 decimals of land, which was easily accessible from the nearby river. At present, it is about a kilometre from Aminbazar bridge by road to the south and the Karnatali River to the north. Even a few years back, the mosque and the main building could be seen from the Dhaka-Aricha highway. But because of rapid urbanisation and unplanned development, one can now hardly notice them behind the newly constructed shops and markets.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The whole complex was originally comprised of four similar&mdash;and one slightly larger&mdash;residential buildings around the inner and outer courtyards. The eastern block was used as a&nbsp;kacharighar&nbsp;(outhouse) for guests and thus situated at the front, adjacent to the pond and the outer courtyard. On the western side of the court, there is the mosque, which is a three-domed structure, oblong in shape, and sits on a high pedestal. There was a large pond with an elegant&nbsp;ghat&nbsp;on each side, except in the south.</p>\r\n<p>The main house was actually placed on the central axis of the pond oriented in the north-south direction. It is genuinely difficult to assume from the road how large the compound was! Behind the colonnaded fa&ccedil;ade of the two-storied main house, there is still a small inner courtyard hidden behind the new expansions. Originally, the courtyard always bustled with people and daily chores. It was a place where children used to play, and women used to gossip and might have spent many idle afternoons by stitching&nbsp;nakshi kantha&nbsp;(hand-embroidered quilt). The east, west and northern blocks are basically the same. Each of them has three compartments and a long connecting corridor facing the court. The corridor, which also acted as a veranda, is decorated with simple semi-circular arched openings. Almost all the attractive cast-iron decorations on the arched way are now gone. Only the main house is currently in a liveable condition; others are in dire straits. Ancillary facilities such as the kitchen and lavatories were in the north-east corners, but at present, they lie in ruins.</p>\r\n<p>The defacing of the compound started when a major portion of the pond was filled up and a road was constructed from the central&nbsp;ghat&nbsp;of the pond, adjacent to the mosque. The&nbsp;ghat&nbsp;was used for the purpose of ablution. A new ablution place was later constructed. The half-demolished boundary wall is still there, but the building located on the east site is almost in ruins. Only a few segments of the main building to the north of the pond are in a liveable condition. The inner courtyard, dotted with numerous trees, has shrunken with encroachment in the form of extended new structures like kitchen, toilet or extra living spaces. The beautiful ornamentations on the colonnaded fa&ccedil;ade, doors and windows are disappearing day by day.</p>\r\n<p>One can find a detailed description and drawings of Dewanbari in the book&nbsp;Mosque Architecture in Bangladesh, written by Dr Abu Sayed M Ahmed and published by the UNESCO in 2006. Old photographs of these buildings can also be found in the National Archives. Moreover, because of the exquisite beauty of the compound, it was once considered an attractive shooting location. Quite a few movies including&nbsp;Matir Moyna,&nbsp;Ei Desh Tomar Amar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ke Tumi&nbsp;were shot in this beautiful complex.</p>\r\n<p>It is unfortunate that no effective steps have been taken yet to protect these magnificent structures and the complex. Although Dewanbari is situated at the gateway to the city from the north-west corridor, not a single demarcation line has been drawn to demonstrate the building as a preserved site. If no immediate step is taken, it will face the same tragic fate as many other heritage sites in Dhaka.</p>', '2019-07-24 09:02:27', '0', '9', '2', '1563958892dewanbari_complex.jpg', ' Naomi Okubo,Advice ,Airbnb Magazine,case studies,Life Lessons,Startup,Tech,Women In Tech'),
(29, 'A First-Class Ghost', '<p>We had just moved to Kolkata for our schooling. Not that we thought Kolkata schools were better than mofussil ones. Schools are the same everywhere&mdash;cast in the same mold. All schools force-feed lessons but sadly no one becomes educated; and even if they do, it is thanks to their own merit, not that of the curriculum or the teachers. Actually, we had come to save ourselves from malaria.</p>\r\n<p>Three months or so after we arrived, Sarada-dada unexpectedly appeared as our house-guest. I don&rsquo;t know on what connection we used to address him as dada. He was neither our relative nor in-law; he was not even from our village. Wherever his ancestral village was, he didn&rsquo;t have a home there. He was a social drifter. During that time our part of the country was crammed with zamindars like the termites in a termite hill. And with each of them he had some sort of a connection; what exactly it was, nobody knew. He lived off the hospitality of these people and everybody welcomed and treated him warmly. He was a Brahmin and a gentleman in speech and demeanor. So whatever he was&mdash; a brother, uncle or distant in-law, everyone was eager to have him as a guest. He would never ask anyone for money. He was supposed to have a widowed relative in Kashi, and he would get money from her whenever needed. Her name was Sukhoda. Sukhoda had abundant wealth but no children; being closely related to Sukhoda lent him a special status.</p>\r\n<p>We, the boys, were delighted to see him although we&rsquo;d had never seen him or heard his name before. We felt that finally here was someone we could talk to. In Kolkata, we had no relatives, not even friends&mdash; with whom we could talk and pass the time. We didn&rsquo;t enjoy talking to our schoolmates. Back then, conversation with Kolkata boys was as insipid as the milk sold in Kolkata&mdash;watered down.</p>\r\n<p>Every evening Sarada-dada used to regale us with stories; the stories of the things he had experienced in life. Of course, Mother had warned us that whatever Sarada said was out and out false. But that didn&rsquo;t deter us. Because though lies are not acceptable in court, they are always present in stories. Anyway, Sarada-dada mostly told us ghost stories. But we never revealed it to Mother. We had heard that the man who supplied father with hookah tobacco used to tell ghost stories to our elder brother. As a result, at night, he would get scared to go from one room to another. Then Father barred the tobacco-seller from entering our house. Lest mother turned Sarada-dada out, we never repeated these stories before her. Besides, there is no fear of ghosts in Kolkata. The streets have lamps and are lined with rows of houses&mdash; no jungle anywhere. Ghosts are afraid of light and hubbub. Whatever the brilliance of the light, the tumult is far greater. Ghosts never appear amidst such hullaballoo. Sarada-dada only told us stories of ghosts he had seen with his own eyes. One day I asked him, &ldquo;You tell us stories of village-ghosts only. Haven&rsquo;t you ever met a sahib-ghost?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sarada-dada answered&mdash;&ldquo;Where would I see them? Europeans don&rsquo;t die in this country. How will they become ghosts if they don&rsquo;t die? Huge train collisions occur here and thousands of natives die; but have you ever heard that a single sahib died?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Then who lie buried in those cemeteries?&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;All are Eurasians. Listen, I am not saying that no European dies here. But we don&rsquo;t come across those who have become ghosts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In this country, their ghosts don&rsquo;t live in trees or walk around. They travel first-class in trains and the Eurasian ones second-class. However, I did see a sahib ghost once, though it&rsquo;s very painful to relate the experience. Even now thinking about it brings tears to my eyes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We want to hear the story of the sahib-ghost.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sarada-dada began after a long sigh, &ldquo;Very well, but never repeat it to anyone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who knows, I might have to face a defamation charge. Even a dead man can bring such a charge and one may be fined or jailed. I don&rsquo;t want to rot in jail again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Then Sarada-dada began&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>Once I was going to Kashi from Kolkata. When I reached Howrah station, the train was about to leave. So I got into an empty first-class compartment, thinking that I would get off at the next station and switch to third-class. As soon as the train started moving, a sahib appeared from the bathroom. He was at least six feet six inches tall, ruddy-faced, with googly eyes. He smelt strongly of drink, and it was foreign liquor. Stepping into the compartment he said, &ldquo;You Blackie, just get off.&rdquo; By then my nerves were shattered and I was trembling as I said, &ldquo;Sir, how can I get off now? I will leave at the next station.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Impossible! Your clothes are very dirty and you stink. Go to the bathroom, take off your clothes and wash yourself. And stay there. Come out when I get off. Do as I say, don&rsquo;t you know that I am the Burra Sahib of the Railway?&rdquo; Fearing for my life, I did just as he said, that is&mdash; I went into the bathroom that wintry night, stripped myself and washed my whole body. Suddenly a gust of wind carried away all my clothes. I remained sitting in the bathroom, soaked and completely naked. Meanwhile, the Burra Sahib was stomping about the compartment, and occasionally hurling endearments at me&mdash; swine, ass, monkey etc. I quietly swallowed the abuse.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly an hour went by. I was all wet and shivering and without a stitch on my body. And on the other side of the wall, the Burra Sahib was tippling away and prancing about.</p>\r\n<p>The train stopped for about a minute. There was a click, the sound of the latch being opened. Then the train moved on. Not a sound on the other side of the wall; so I tried to enter the compartment. Good Lord! The Burra Sahib had put the latch on of the bathroom door. I remained trapped in the darkness. Half an hour later when the train reached Bardhaman, I stuck my head out of the bathroom window and without caring for consequences, started shouting, &lsquo;Porter, porter!&rsquo; Then a porter came, opened the latch of the door, turned on the light and fled on seeing me naked, as he thought I was a ghost. Eventually, when the stationmaster came and declared&mdash;&ldquo;Not a ghost, a thief,&rdquo; the porters pounced on me, thrashed me till I was half-dead and dragged me to the platform.</p>\r\n<p>The stationmaster said, &ldquo;Quick, give him something to wear. If a memsahib suddenly appears and faints at the sight of this naked fellow, I will lose my job.&rdquo; A passenger gave me a sari which I wrapped around my body. Then I told the stationmaster everything that had happened and he said that the Burra Sahib of the Railway was in Shimla. Besides, no sahib had got on the train or got off anywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Now I realized that the creature at whose hand I had suffered such humiliation was not a sahib, but a sahib&rsquo;s ghost.</p>\r\n<p>Then the stationmaster sent me off to the police station. There too I suffered a round of beating before the interrogation by the officer in charge. I repeated my story. He believed me, for he had once been harried by a female ghost.</p>\r\n<p>The following day the OC took me to the court. My offense was supposed to be grievous and I should be prosecuted without any delay. The judge was a true gentleman and highly educated as well. He believed the story of being harassed by a ghost in the train, because he was an ardent theosophist. But it was pointless to invoke God and ghosts in the court of the British Raj. The existence of God and ghosts is not accepted there. He had no alternative but to sentence me to a month in jail. My offense was traveling first-class without a ticket in a naked state, while being high on ganja. As a final warning he said, &ldquo;You can smoke ganja if you like; but when you do, don&rsquo;t get on a train without a ticket, especially in the guise of a naked sadhu; and particularly in first-class.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I said, &ldquo;Your honour, I don&rsquo;t smoke ganja.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He said, &ldquo;As a ganja-smoker you got off with a light sentence. Otherwise, I would have sent you to the Sessions Court.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Now you have heard the story of a first-class ghost. Compared with them, the rustic ghosts are much more well-mannered!</p>', '2019-07-24 09:06:40', '0', '4', '2', '1563959101rape_30.jpg', ' Naomi Okubo,Advice ,Airbnb Magazine,case studies,Life Lessons,Startup,Tech,Women In Tech'),

(31, 'The Guest', '<p>The total number of guests adds up to forty-odd. It is too many, yet Nishat and I are not prepared to drop any. I have just finished my PhD and we are leaving America to take up my new job in Saudi Arabia. It is time for celebration, it is time to say goodbye.</p>\r\n<p>We now have to solve a couple of problems. First, we cannot accommodate so many guests in our university apartment. So, we decide to split it in to two events&ndash; about twenty invitees on each occasion. Second, Nishat needs a few large pots and pans for her cooking. She suggests that we borrow them from our Indian friends Topon and Deepa Mollik, who live a couple of miles down the road.</p>\r\n<p>We fix the dates a week apart and make two guest lists with their phone numbers. We even decide who will call whom and what not. I cover the outdoor and some indoor preparation, like helping in the kitchen and with the cleaning. Nishat covers the bulk of the indoor work&ndash; the cooking and serving.</p>\r\n<p>It is almost noon when I get off the university shuttle bus. On the hot summer&rsquo;s day I begin to perspire, even after this shortest of a walk. Deepa opens the door and invites me in.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you all moving?&rdquo; I ask, seeing the entrance hall is full of boxes and pots and pans.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph-wrapper\">\r\n<div id=\"dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>She laughs. &ldquo;No. The exterminator came this morning, so we have this mess.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I do not know about the rest of Texas, but cockroaches are a nuisance in Austin, particularly during the summer when it is hot and humid. And they are never just a few; there are probably dozens, invisible during the day. It is at night they come out, looking for food all over the place &ndash; in the kitchen stove, sinks, shelves, tables, garbage bins, floors and even the bathroom. We keep the kitchen and bathroom spotless, shiny clean, yet it does not help.</p>\r\n<p>Despite their unpleasant looks, the cockroaches are interesting creatures with quite a few unique traits. They multiply exponentially, for the females will have up to forty babies at one time; they can live with little water and can go without food for a month; they may become thin but do not die of starvation for, like termites, their close cousins, they have a unique digestive system that allows them to eat almost anything, including paper, clothes and book binders; they can walk, jump and fly; their lightning reactions, armour-plated bodies and ability to hide themselves in all sorts of places make extermination virtually impossible. They prefer to live in warm, moist places and are more abundant in tropical areas. However, they can live in almost any environment. They have even been sighted at the Poles!</p>\r\n<p>Cockroaches are one of the oldest surviving creatures (some 350 million years) and the only creature that can withstand radiation &ndash; they would not become extinct even in a nuclear catastrophe. To put things in perspective, they predate the very first known dinosaurs by150 million years and were around not only to watch their demise but also remain in our world to day in a nearly unchanged form. In fact, they&rsquo;ve needed to evolve so little in all this time that fossils of the species are nearly identical to living specimens found today. None of the cockroach species is known to be listed as endangered. They are the most perfect of all creations and yet, ironically, sodespised.</p>\r\n<p>Deepa asks me to take a seat and offers me a drink. I explain to her that I have got to run to catch the returning bus. She hands me two large paper bags containing the requested pots and pans.</p>\r\n<p>I feel relieved to find that the bus has not yet arrived. There are a few students waiting at the bus stop. There is not much room left to take shelter from the hot sun. There isn&rsquo;t much shade underneath the only barren tree, either. I put the bags down and stand near the tree trunk, hoping that the bus will arrive soon.</p>\r\n<p>Something catches my eyes. I find a thin, malnourished cockroach, that has probably not had food for weeks, shuffling out of one of the bags. He obviously saved himself by hiding while the exterminators were rampaging all over the place.</p>\r\n<p>With a sudden jolt, I throw him off the bag. He instantly jumps back on it, sensing burning sands and pebbles under his feet. This time I give a sharper jolt to throw him further away.</p>\r\n<p>He is lost in a desert, with burning sands underneath and a glaring sun straight above his head, without any shade or water in sight, unless he sees a mirage miles away. He is weak, vulnerable and hapless. He may be the most perfect of all creations, but is still no match for this hostile environment. If his physiology is similar to that of humans, he will soon suffer from hallucinations and then run mad. At some point, he might collapse unconscious and eventually his respiratory system would fail.</p>\r\n<p>Now here I am playing a game. Firstly, I throw this innocent creature into hellfire and then watch his fate unfold right before my eyes.&nbsp;Why? What right do I have to play with his fate? Does he not suffer? Does he not feel pain?</p>\r\n<p>I push the bag in front of the cockroach. He jumps on it and instantly disappears into the safe haven through its wide-open top.</p>\r\n<p>The bus comes in time and I pick up the bags. I do not think it will matter.
